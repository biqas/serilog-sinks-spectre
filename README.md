# Serilog.Sinks.SpectreConsole

Serilog sink for [Spectre.Console](https://spectreconsole.net/).

Started as C# port of the F# package [Serilog.Sinks.SpectreConsole](https://github.com/PragmaticFlow/Serilog.Sinks.SpectreConsole), later the code has been refactored to be more in line with the internal design of Spectre.Console.
